# Skybase Flutter Intern Project

## Task Overview
Your task is to replicate a specific screen in a Flutter app based on the provided design. You will work with two APIs to fetch and display data for categories and sub-categories. The screen layout features categories arranged in an 'L' shape around the edges, with scrollable sub-categories displayed in the negative space of the 'L'.
